  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to create an application for users to enter and update employee information into a SQL database using the command line. It's a simple way for users who aren't famlilar with SQL syntax to control a database. The project was done in JavaScript and SQL, and I used the inquirer, console.table, and mysql2 npm packages.

  ## Installation
  You must have a source code editor tool, such as VS Code, TextEdit on Mac, or NotePad on Windows. Additionally, you will need node.js installed. 
  
  Once those tools are installed, hit the “code” button in this repository and copy the link. In your command line, type "git clone" followed by pasting the copied link to clone onto your own local machine. 
  
  Once you're in your project via the code editing software as well as in the command line, type "npm install" in your command line to ensure you have all the modules needed.

  
  ## Usage
  This application could be used in any professional setting.
  
  To start using this application, simply type “node index.js” into the command line. You will then get a fun EMPLOYEE TRACKER graphic, and a menu asking what you'd like to do, ranging from viewing database tables, adding data, or updating data. Each selection will trigger a different function. After you complete your task, you will get a success message and will be taken back to the main menu. As you add information, you can go back and view the tables and you will see the information just added will now be in the database. 

  To exit, either select "No Action" from the menu, or press CTRL + C.
